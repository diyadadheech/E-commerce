Create a fully functional e-commerce grocery website using React.js for the frontend (with React Router for navigation), Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for the database. 
The site should allow users to log in via phone number verification (OTP), and then collect name, email, and address details (optional to skip until checkout). 
The homepage should display grocery categories like Milk, Curd & Dairy; Vegetables & Fruits; Cakes & Biscuits; Aata, Rice & Dal; Oil, Ghee & Masala; Dry Fruits; Bakery; Drinks; Chocolates; and Toiletries, each linking to a page showing all items in that category with images, brand, price, discount, and expiry date. 
The user should be able to filter or sort items by price or discount, view detailed product pages, and add products to a shopping cart with a visible cart icon showing the item count. Ensure a clean, responsive, and modern UI with smooth navigation.
The backend should handle data operations, OTP verification, and cart state management, while the database should come preloaded with multiple grocery items and images automatically (no manual data entry required).
